       Some functions in kernel marked as always inline. This means
       that these functions will always be inline even if you disabled compiler
       optimisation. Note: disabling of this option is not a very good idea, but in some
       cases(for example for debugging) it may have a sense.

       occupy all available CPUs in system.

       Maximum amount of deferred interrupt actions kernel fires per at one time tick.
       If more than such amount of deferred actions are ready for firing at the same time,
       the rest of these actions will be processed during the next suitable suituation.
